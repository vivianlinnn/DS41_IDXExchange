Linear Regression model _ Liz Choi + Evaluation_Steven

We first built a baseline Linear Regression model using only core numerical housing features:
Features=[LivingArea, BedroomsTotal, BathroomsTotalInteger, LotSizeAcres, YearBuilt]
These variables capture the fundamental structural characteristics of a property.

To improve predictive performance, we extended the model by incorporating additional categorical property features, including:
[ViewYN, PoolPrivateYN, NewConstructionYN, FireplaceYN]
Since Linear Regression requires numerical inputs, these categorical variables were transformed using one-hot encoding:
